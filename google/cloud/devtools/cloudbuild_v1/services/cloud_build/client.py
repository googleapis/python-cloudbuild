        This method creates a new build using the original build

        For triggered builds:

        -  Triggered builds resolve to a precise revision; therefore a
           retry of a triggered build will result in a build that uses
           the same revision.

        For non-triggered builds that specify ``RepoSource``:

           retried build will build from the tip of that branch, which
           may not be the same revision as the original build.
        -  If the original build specified a commit sha or revision ID,
           the retried build will use the identical source.

        For builds that specify ``StorageSource``:

        -  If the original build pulled source from Google Cloud Storage
           without specifying the generation of the object, the new
           build will use the current object, which may be different
           from the original build source.
        -  If the original build pulled source from Cloud Storage and
           specified the generation of the object, the new build will
           attempt to use the same object, which may or may not be
           available depending on the bucket's lifecycle management
           settings.

        Args:
            request (:class:`~.cloudbuild.RetryBuildRequest`):
                The request object. Specifies a build to retry.
